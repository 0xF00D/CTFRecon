# CTFRecon

Basic bash script to automate CTF(e.g.,hackthebox,tryhackme) initialization.

Tools used in script:

1. [nmap](https://nmap.org/)
2. [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)

*ctfrecon writes to /etc/hosts so it is recommended to run it as root.*

```bash
Usage: sudo ./ctfrecon.sh [IP] [DIRECTORY NAME] [PLATFORM (e.g., hackthebox,thm)] [WORDLIST]
```

Todo:

- [ ] Fix ugly code.
